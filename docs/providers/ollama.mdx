3. Base URL: `http://localhost:11434/` (default, usually no need to change)
4. Select your model from the dropdown

### Recommended Models

For the best experience with CodinIT, use **Qwen3 Coder 30B**. This model provides strong coding capabilities and reliable tool use for local development.

To download it:
```bash
ollama run qwen3-coder-30b
```

Other capable models include:
- `mistral-small` - Good balance of performance and speed
- `devstral-small` - Optimized for coding tasks

### Important Notes

-   Start Ollama before using with CodinIT
-   Keep Ollama running in background
-   First model download may take several minutes

### Enable Compact Prompts

For better performance with local models, enable compact prompts in CodinIT settings. This reduces the prompt size by 90% while maintaining core functionality.

Navigate to CodinIT Settings → Features → Use Compact Prompt and toggle it on.

### Troubleshooting

If CodinIT can't connect to Ollama:

1. Verify Ollama is running
2. Check base URL is correct
3. Ensure model is downloaded
