    ### What Works in JetBrains

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="✅ All Core Features" defaultOpen>
        - Diff editing and file modifications
        - Multiple API providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, local models)
        - MCP servers and custom tools
        - Codinit rules and workflows
        - @ mentions for files, folders, and problems
        - Drag & drop support
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="📋 Terminal Integration Difference">
        **JetBrains shows terminal output differently than VS Code:**
        - VS Code: Output streams directly to chat
        - JetBrains: Output appears in collapsible "Command Output" sections
        
        Commands execute successfully in both—just expand the section to see results in JetBrains.

    **Plugin Installation Issues**

    If you can't find Codinit in the marketplace:
    - Make sure you're searching in the **Marketplace** tab (not Installed)
    - Try searching for "Codinit AI" or just "Codinit"
    - Check that your IDE version is compatible (2023.1 or later recommended)

    If installation fails:
    - Restart your IDE and try again
    - Check your internet connection
    - Try installing from disk as an alternative

    **Plugin Not Appearing**

    If you don't see the Codinit tool window after installation:
    - Restart your IDE completely (File → Exit and reopen)
    - Check **View** → **Tool Windows** → **Codinit**
    - Verify the plugin is enabled in **Settings** → **Plugins** → **Installed** tab
    - Look for the Codinit icon in your IDE's tool window bar (usually on the right side)

    **Common Issues**

    Plugin appears to be installed but doesn't work:
    - Ensure you've restarted your IDE after installation
    - Check if there are any error messages in the IDE's event log
    - Try disabling and re-enabling the plugin in Settings

    Performance or compatibility issues:
    - Make sure you're using a supported JetBrains IDE version
    - Check for IDE updates that might improve compatibility
    - Consider allocating more memory to your IDE if needed
